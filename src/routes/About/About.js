                            The image files provided are part of a continuing effort. The archive will be periodically updated as more slides are scanned and as more postmortem donations are received by the MS-NBTR.

                            The slide images are high resolution digital neuropathology files of multiple brain regions (e.g., middle frontal gyrus, cingulate gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, hippocampus, amygdala, basal ganglia, thalamus, etc.) and multiple histochemical and immunohistochemical stains (e.g., H&E, modified Bielschowsky, amyloid beta, phosphorylated tau, alpha synuclein, TDP-43) per brain region of persons with no evident brain-related disorders, or brain disorders ranging from psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia and major depression to Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Lewy body disease and cerebrovascular disease.

                            Some digital neuropathology slides are from donors who died by suicide. The collection includes digital neuropathology slides from persons spanning the entire human lifespan, but it is concentrated on donors who died between the ages of 65-90 years.
